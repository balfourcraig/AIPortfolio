                <h2>"Hidden" logos &amp; text</h2>
                <p>
                    The following images contain "hidden" text. If you have
                    trouble seeing it, stand further back or blur your eyes
                    slightly. The text will magically appear. When you move
                    closer again, it will begin to disappear into the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Text and logos can be hidden to a greater or lesser degree.
                    The more hidden ones would be best when viewed from across a
                    room, as a subtle and interesting advertising piece that
                    (for now) very few businesses are using.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any logo or text can potentially work, but more simple, high
                    contrast ones will work best. Complex or long text will tend
                    to either get lost in the details, or stand out too
                    obviously and not blend with the picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, image subjects with lots of noisy visual clutter
                    will work best to hide the text in, and primarily black and
                    white works best. Clean flat images won't have anywhere to
                    hide.
                </p>
                <p>I'm happy to work with you in finding a good option.</p>
